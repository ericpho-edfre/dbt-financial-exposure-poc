    description: >
      Hub table for projects coming from Project Tracker, built following Data Vault 2.0 raw vault standards.
      It captures the unique business key `project_id` and its associated hash key `hub_hk`, 
      along with metadata such as load timestamp and record source.
    columns:
      - name: hub_hk
        description: >
          Surrogate hash key generated from the business key(s) using `generate_surrogate_key(['project_id'])`.
          Serves as the primary unique identifier for the hub.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

      - name: project_id
        description: >

      - name: load_date
        description: >
          Timestamp indicating when the record was loaded into the raw vault.
          Typically set using `current_timestamp` during model execution.

      - name: record_source
        description: >
          Indicates the source system from which the record originated.

  - name: hub_sap_project
    description: >
      Hub model for SAP project entities, generated from the staging table `stg_sap_project`.
      Following Data Vault 2.0 raw vault standards, this model captures the unique business identifiers from 
      the SAP system to form the core project concept.
    columns:
      - name: hub_hk
        description: >
          Surrogate hash key serving as the unique identifier for the hub. Typically derived
          from the business key(s).

        description: >
          Timestamp indicating when the record was loaded into the Data Vault.

      - name: record_source
        description: >
          Metadata field indicating the source system or process that loaded this record.
          Expected to be "SAP PROJ" for this model.

  - name: hub_sap_wbs
    description: >
      Hub model capturing unique WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) elements from the SAP PRPS source.
      Built using the `generate_hub` macro and sourced from the `stg_sap_wbs` staging table
      and built following Data Vault 2.0 raw vault standards.This hub represents the core business 
      concept of WBS within the SAP project system.
    columns:
      - name: hub_hk
        description: >
          Surrogate hash key uniquely identifying a WBS hub record. Generated from the business keys.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

      - name: sap_client_id

  - name: link_wbs_project
    description: >
      Data Vault link table connecting SAP WBS, SAP Project, and Project Tracker entities. 
      Uses incremental append-only strategy to track relationship changes over time with full audit trail. 
      Generates surrogate keys for each source system, handles NULLs as 'UNKNOWN', and captures both 
      link creation (is_active=TRUE) and expiration (is_active=FALSE) events. Only inserts records 
      when link state changes, maintaining Data Vault 2.0 compliance with complete historical lineage.
